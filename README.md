### Notes
The most difficult part of the assignment was importing the images using cocoapods. Prior to this project, I wasn't very familiar with terminal commands so installing cocoapods was difficult. However, after that hurdle everything else came easy like importing AlamoFireImage in order to display the movie posters in the app.
